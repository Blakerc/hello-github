# hello-github
a test repository for education

This is a test, the date is 1/5/2021 and I've just take a position as a full stack developer intern at Refract Labs!


The world is a mess due to covid and politics. The vaccine is around the corner and Joe Biden has been elected with VP kamala harris.

I am happy! There is a lot to look forward too.

Hopefully next time I read this I'm not in a wall-e floating wheelchair.
